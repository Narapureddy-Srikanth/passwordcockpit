# Passwordcockpit - develop environment

## General 

This README will explain the steps needed to setup and start the Passwordcockpit for development purposes.

## Requirements

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are needed for the setup.

## Installation

First of all: copy the `docker-compose-develop.yml` file in your project folder, and rename it to `docker-compose.yml`.<br>
The IP of the host machine is needed. Replace `[YOUR_IP]` in the `docker-compose.yml` file with your ip. There should be 3 replacements.

Then simply run `docker-compose up`.

Images needed by the docker-compose file are provided from [its Docker Hub organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/passwordcockpit).

This will install the Passwordcockpit webapp, and create in the current folder `backend`, `frontend` and `database` folders.
The `backend` and `frontend` folders are GIT projects.<br>
The database will already contain some tests data.

The environment variables can be modified, but please note that if you want to modify PASSWORDCOCKPIT_BLOCK_CIPHER_KEY, all passwords should be deleted from the database since they are encrypted with this key.

## First step

the `docker-compose up` command may take a while. The web application will be ready when the following message appears:
```
passwordcockpit_frontend    | Build successful (....ms) â€“ Serving on http://localhost:4200/
```

After that, go to `[YOUR-IP]:4200`. If everything went correctly, there should be a login page.<br>
If the first login results in a `Undefined error`, the certificate needs to be accepted. In most browsers, simply go to `[YOUR_IP]:4344` and accept it.

Login again, and the application is ready to be used.
